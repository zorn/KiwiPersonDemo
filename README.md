This small Xcode project showcases simple use of [Kiwi](https://github.com/allending/Kiwi), a Behavior Driven Development library for iOS development.

It was part of a presentation at [Philly CocoaHeads](http://phillycocoa.org/) of which the slides are also in this repo.

To get up in running clone the repo and sure to pull the submodules as well:

    $ git submodule update --init

If you have any questions let me know.
